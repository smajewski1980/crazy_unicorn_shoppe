      Welcome to my first full-stack app! As you can probably tell, I am
      certainly not a designer, just someone who loves to code and has a silly
      sense of humor. Below are the technical details of my... eh, em...
      masterpiece, from creating a frontend to creating a full rest API to
      setting up a databse.
    </p>
    <p>
      In summary, this app has the ability for a user to create an account
      initiated either locally or through a Google Oauth signin. Then the user
      can "shop"! The products have their inventory displayed with the product
      info, which is updated when an order is submitted, and subsequently
      updated again if an order is canceled. The user will be notified with a
      toast notification if they exceed the inventory when they add the item to
      the cart. The users active shopping cart data persists after logout and is
      reloaded on login. On the checkout page, the user may change an item's qty
      or remove an item from the cart. The user also has the ability to edit
      their info during checkout. When a user is logged in, they have access to
      their orders page, which offers a list of all the users orders and allows
      the user to click on one for more detail or to cancel the order if it is
      pending. --*There is also the ability for an admin user to have access to
      an add product page.*--
    </p>
    <h2>frontend</h2>
    <p>
      The frontend portion of this site was made using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla
      Javascript. I have nothing against frontend frameworks, I have played with
      a little react.js, but I feel at this point in my coding journey it is
      very powerful to understand and practice the fundamentals.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only js library I used in the frontend was toastify-js for toasting
      some errors, I know, I have a rye sense of humor... I am using SASS as a
      CSS pre-processor. The only comment on the HTML is that the product images
      and descriptions along with all the images of unicorns, were all generated
      using AI. I use GIMP 3.0 as my image editor which is what I created the
      main logo and a few of the buttons with.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the time of this writing, I still have not written any media queries. I
      have tried to code everything to be as implicitly responsive as I can. The
      site is also keyboard navigable all the way from signing in or up to
      placing an order.
    </p>
    <h2>backend</h2>
    <p>
      This is an express.js app which utilizes a few packages. I was able to in
      conjunction with nodemon, use a package called livereload to be able to
      auto refresh the browser after a nodemon restart when a file changes.
      While we are talking about the dev environment, I use VS Code for my code
      editor and have eslint set up in the project and use dotenv to handle
      environment variables. To compile and serve Sass files, I used
      express-dart-sass.
    </p>
    <p>
      This app uses bcrypt for hashing passwords. When I set up the database, I
      hadn't considered just how long the hashed passwords would be and I had to
      alter the table column's data type after the fact, no biggie. I use
      Passport.js to handle user auth, using a local strategy and the
      google-oauth20 strategy. I also used Helmet for some automated beefing up
      of my response headers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Session management is handled with express-session and validation with
      express-validator. Also, I used Morgan for some logging and node-postgres
      to talk to the database.
